# ZoteroMods2IIIFMods
Shell script from Zotero mods export to IIIF image server mods format
# Note
in order for the coordinate information to work with this script, the zotero tags for the bounding box of coordinates should be tagged within zotero with `<coordinates> </coordinates>` (eg. `<coordinates>22,43,40,51</coordinates>`). Other cartographic tags such as projection are not implemented.
